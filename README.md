# Controlled-Chaos-Fancybox
A WordPress plugin to add Fancybox 3 functionality to images and galleries.

## Default Behavior
The plugin sets the add image "Link to" field as "File" by default.

## Single Images
Links to single image files added via the content editor are detected automatically and open in Fancybox individually. Images linked to content or external sites will follow the link as expected.

## Gallery Images
Gallery images will will open in Fancybox with the other images in the gallery. Galleries are segregated by ID for use with multiple galleries per post.
